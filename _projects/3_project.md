**Transistor Stacking** beyond GAA represents the next frontier in semiconductor innovation, aiming to push the limits of device scaling and performance. While Gate-All-Around (GAA) transistors have enabled significant improvements in miniaturization and efficiency, stacking technologies extend these advancements by vertically stacking multiple transistor layers. This approach offers several advantages, including enhanced drive current, reduced footprint, and increased transistor density, all while maintaining low power consumption.

The key benefit of transistor stacking is the ability to integrate multiple logic and memory layers in a single package, addressing the growing demand for high-performance computing, memory-intensive applications, and miniaturized devices. By utilizing 3D stacking, these technologies enable the development of chips that are more powerful and efficient, which are crucial for the next generation of mobile, AI, and data center applications.

With continued advancements in material science, bonding techniques, and fabrication processes, transistor stacking beyond GAA holds the potential to enable even smaller, faster, and more energy-efficient devices, driving the future of integrated circuit design.
