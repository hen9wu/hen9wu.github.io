I am an associate professor at the School of Integrated Circuits of Peking University. 

I was a Research Staff Member at IBM T. J. Watson Research Center in New York State USA from 2016 to 2022. I received the Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Purdue University in 2016. My research focuses on Design Technology Co-optimization (DTCO), 3D Integration, VLSI Technology Development and Semiconductor Devices&Physics. 

I am a recipient of Best Paper Awards of several renowned conferences such as VLSI2024, DRC2015, SRC2015 and SISC2013. I also received the IEEE Paul Rappaport Award and was appointed as "IBM Master Inventor".
