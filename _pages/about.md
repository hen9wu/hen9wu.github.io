I am an associate professor at the School of Integrated Circuits of Peking University since 2023.

I was a Research Staff Member at <a href='https://research.ibm.com/labs/albany/'>IBM T. J. Watson Research Center</a> in New York State, USA from 2016 to 2022, working towards _Next-gen Semiconductor Technology_. Prior to this, I received the Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Purdue University under Professor <a href='https://engineering.purdue.edu/~yep/'>P.D. Ye</a> in 2016, with a thesis on _Beyond Si CMOS Technology_. My research focuses on Design Technology Co-optimization (<a href='https://www.imec-int.com/en/articles/getting-most-out-your-system'>DTCO</a>), <a href='https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-cmos'>3D Integration</a>, <a href='https://www.semiconductor-digest.com/new-structure-transistors-for-advanced-technology-node-cmos-ics/'>VLSI Technology Development</a> and Semiconductor Devices&Physics. 

I am a recipient of Best Paper Awards of several renowned conferences such as <a href='http://www.vlsisymposium.org/'>VLSI</a>2024, <a href='https://2025.deviceresearchconference.org/'>DRC</a>2015, <a href='https://www.src.org/calendar/e005106/'>TECHON</a>2015 and <a href='https://www.ieeesisc.org/'>SISC</a>2013. I also received the IEEE Paul Rappaport Award and was appointed as "IBM Master Inventor".
